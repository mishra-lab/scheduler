The need for quality software solutions is acute for a number of reasons. In particular, it is very important to efﬁciently utilise time and effort, to evenly balance the workload among people and to attempt to satisfy personnel preferences. A high quality roster can lead to a more contented and thus more effective workforce.},

Hospital objectives include ensuring a continuous service with appropriate nursing skills and sta ng size, while avoiding additional costs for unnecessary overtime. Nurses preferences, which are deduced from a survey conducted on-purpose for the sake of this study, include mainly fairness considerations, in terms of ratio of night shifts and weekends o , in addition to avoiding isolated days on and o . The model is implemented in an experimental phase of six-month period using LINGO and is considered to perform reasonably well, based both on some quality criteria displayed in the literature and on the feedback obtained from a second survey, that has been developed to assess the scheduling system performance.},

However, the classical genetic algorithm (GA) paradigm is not well equipped to handle the conflict between objectives and constraints that typically occur in such problems. In order to overcome this, successful implementations frequently make use of problem specific knowledge. This paper is concerned with the development of a GA for a nurse rostering problem at a major U.K. hospital. The structure of the constraints is used as the basis for a co-evolutionary strategy using co-operating subpopulations. Problem-specific knowledge is also used to define a system of incentives and disincentives, and a complementary mutation operator. Empirical results based on 52 weeks of data show how these features are able to improve an unsuccessful canonical GA to the point where it is able to provide a practical solution to the problem.

The objective of this research is to investigate difficulties that occur during the solution of NSP using evolutionary algorithms, in particular genetic algorithms (GA). As the solution method a population-less cooperative genetic algorithm (CGA) is taken into consideration. Because contrary to competitive GAs, we have to simultaneously deal with the optimization of the fitness of the individual nurses and also optimization of the entire schedule as the final solution to the problem in hand. To confirm the search ability of CGA, first a simplified version of NSP is examined. Later we report a more complex and useful version of the problem. We also compare CGA with another multi-agent evolutionary algorithm using pheromone style communication of real ants. Finally, we report the results of computer simulations acquired throughout the experiments.},

	abstract = {The Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) is a problem of allocating shifts (day and night shifts, holidays, and so on) for nurses under various constraints. Generally, NSP has a lot of constraints. As a result, it needs a lot of knowledge and experience to construct the scheduling table with its constraints, and it is usually done by the head nurse or the authority in hospitals. Some research on NSP using genetic algorithms (GA) is reported. Conventional methods take the constraints into the fitness function. However, if it reduces the fitness value a lot to the parts of solution against the constraints, it causes useless search, because most of the chromosomes are selected in the initial population or in the change by the genetic operations. If it doesn't reduce the fitness value so much, the final solution has some parts against the constraints. Some of them are established by the Labor Standards Act or the Labor Union Act, so the solution has to be modified. As a result, it is difficult to acquire an effective scheduling table automatically. The paper studies the method of coding and genetic operations with their constraints for NSP. The exchange of shifts is done to satisfy the constraints in the coding and after the genetic operations. We apply this method to NSP using actual shifts and constraints being used in a hospital. It shows that an effective scheduling table satisfying the constraints is acquired by this method.},

In the second phase, adjustments with descend local search and tabu search are applied to improved the solution. This is to satisfy the preference rules as far as possible.

A typical problem comprises 600 to 800 assignments that have to take into account several requirements such as minimal allocation of a station, legal regulations and wishes of the personnel. This planning is a di cult and time-consuming expert task and is still done manually. INTERDIP1 is an advanced industrial prototype that supports semi-automatic creation of such rosters. Using the arti cial intelligence approach, constraint reasoning and constraint programming, INTERDIP creates a roster interactively within some minutes instead of by hand some hours. Additionally, it mostly produces better results. INTERDIP was developed in collaboration with Siemens Nixdorf.

	abstract = {This paper presents a technique called Improved Squeaky Wheel Optimisation (ISWO) for driver scheduling problems. It improves the original Squeaky Wheel Optimisation’s (SWO) effectiveness and execution speed by incorporating two additional steps of Selection and Mutation which implement evolution within a single solution. In the ISWO, a cycle of Analysis-Selection-Mutation-Prioritization-Construction continues until stopping conditions are reached. The Analysis step first computes the fitness of a current solution to identify troublesome components. The Selection step then discards these troublesome components probabilistically by using the fitness measure, and the Mutation step follows to further discard a small number of components at random. After the above steps, an input solution becomes partial and thus the resulting partial solution needs to be repaired. The repair is carried out by using the Prioritization step to first produce priorities that determine an order by which the following Construction step then schedules the remaining components. Therefore, the optimisation in the ISWO is achieved by solution disruption, iterative improvement and an iterative constructive repair process performed. Encouraging experimental results are reported.},

Although similar employee scheduling problems have been addressed in the literature, certain peculiarities of the problem require novel mathematical models and algorithms to deal with the specific nature and size of this problem. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, and a problem size analysis based on real data reveals that the formulation is too complex to solve directly. Hence, a two-stage approach is proposed, where the first stage assigns employees to stations, and the second stage specifies shifts and off-days for each employee. Computational results related to solving the two-stage models directly via CPLEX and by specialized heuristics are reported. The two-stage approach provides daily schedules for employees for a given time horizon in a timely fashion, taking into consideration the employees’ expressed preferences. This proposed modeling approach can be incorporated within a decision support system to replace the current manual scheduling practice that is often chaotic and has led to feelings of bias and job dissatisfaction among employees.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we first provide an MIP formulation of a selection/assignment problem and then we discuss a solution method based both on the use of a commercial general-purpose scatter-search and a simple implementation of tabu search. This optimization problem is related to a research project supported by the Office of Naval Research where sailors need to be selected to perform a set of jobs that require specific skill levels. The results of our computational experiments indicate the usefulness of the software system for workforce planning that we have developed.},
