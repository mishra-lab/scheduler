\subsection{Software}
We developed a software package with a user interface that implements the above LP problem and allows configuration of clinicians at [ref \ref{???}], to be used by the ID division at St. Michael's Hospital. The software was used to generate the results in the following sections, using real data as well as simulated data as input.

\subsection{Infectious Diseases Division}
We used clinician time-off requests and minimum/maximum requirements from 2015-2018 as input data for the LP problem. Tables \ref{tbl:2017-schedule-comparison}, \ref{tbl:2018-schedule-comparison}, \ref{??}, \ref{??} present the optimal schedule generated using the software as well as the manually created schedule, color-coded to distinguish between the different clinicians assigned.

\include{tbl/2017_schedule_comparison}
\include{tbl/2018_schedule_comparison}

In order to evaluate the generated schedule and compare it with the manually created schedule, we outline the adherence of each schedule to the constraints presented in section \ref{???}. As we can see from table \ref{tbl:constraints-comparison}, the generated schedule was able to satisfy all mandatory constraints, however for the years of [???] it could not find an optimal schedule while ensuring that the block assignments are spread out ([???] constraint). On the other hand, we can see that the manually created schedule was not able to satisfy all mandatory constraints. In particular, we see that it contains consecutive block assignments for the years of [???], [...]. Evaluating the objectives, we see that [...\textit{request conflicts}]. Moreover, the manual schedule does not attempt to align weekend assignments with block assignments, unlike the optimal schedule found by the software.

\subsection{Simulations}
In this section, we want to analyze properties of the LP problem on simulated data. Our goal is to see whether the aforementioned formulation of the problem is going to suffer from runtime issues, when presented with a large set of constraints arising from a hypothetical department with many clinicians, or clinicians with many time-off requests throughout the year. We also want to analyze the effect of a longer time-horizon or a large number of divisions in a department, on the run-time of the algorithm. \\

We began by evaluating the runtime in a single-division department, with an increasing number of clinicians, over a 1-year time-span. Figure \ref{fig:avg-runtime-clinicians} shows the average runtime in seconds of 10 runs, for different numbers of clinicians, $C = \{5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100\}$. From the graph, we can see that the LP formulation performs extremely well on a typical hospital department with no more than 30 clinicians [ref \ref{??}], and can even handle busier departments with upwards of 100 clinicians. \\

\end{figure}

Next we evaluated the effect of increasing the number of departments. Figure \ref{fig:avg-runtime-divisions} shows the average runtime for a department with a 10 clinicians, and a range of divisions, $D = \{1, 2, 3\}$. We can see that increasing the number of divisions even by 2 greatly affects the runtime. The LP solver had significant trouble when we increased the number of divisions further, making it impractical to quickly generate schedules for departments with many divisions. \\

\end{figure}

We plotted the effect of an increasing number of requests per clinician on the average runtime of the LP solver in figure \ref{fig:avg-runtime-requests}. We ran the program on a single-division department with 10 clinicians, and $R = \abs{\mathcal{WR}} + \abs{\mathcal{BR}} = \{1, 2, 3, 5, 10\}$ non-overlapping requests per clinician. The increase in the number of requests did not affect the runtime of the LP solver, indicating that it can handle and accommodate much flexibility in clinician requests.
